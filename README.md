# AI Programming with Python Project

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Create-Your-Own-Image-Classifier/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook Image-Classifier-Project.ipynb
```
on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
